      This portfolio is a curated collection of my personal side projectsâ€”things I've built out of curiosity, passion,
      and a drive to explore new ideas. For me, learning isn't just an activity but a lifelong commitment;
      it shapes everything I do, from software engineering to reading and writing.
      Unlike the work I've done for past employers (which remains closed-source), everything here is open for you to explore.
      

      These projects reflect my practical understanding of software engineering principles-from designing scalable systems
      and writing clean, maintainable code, to choosing the right tools for the job.
      You'll see a mix of technologies and programming languages as I enjoy working across the stack
      and diving into new domains whenever the chance arises.
      Alongside building, I'm always seeking to understand the "why" behind the "how", and learning from every challenge.
      
      
      Whether you're here to evaluate my technical skills or just to see what I've been working on,
      I hope you find something interesting. Feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always open to feedback and collaboration!
