  Though my experience with open source is limited, I have made improvements to Temporal.io and Solana documentation,
  and plan to contribute more as I work with new technologies.

Admittedly, open source contributions haven't been my main focus,
as my previous work was mostly with closed-source libraries and tools.
However, I plan to contribute more as I explore new technologies and encounter opportunities for improvement.

Recently, at NinjaVan, I led the adoption and production deployment of Temporal.io, including developer training.
While working with Temporal's Helm chart and documentation, I fixed outdated docs and misconfigurations,
ensuring smoother onboarding for future users.
Additionally, I corrected errors in Solana's developer resources after identifying issues in their Quickstart Guide.
