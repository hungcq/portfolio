[My blog](https://blog.hungcq.xyz) is where I confront questions that seem simple, but reveal complexity the deeper you examine them.
If you're wondering what to expect, the answer is rational critique.
I question traditions and challenge entrenched beliefs, whether that means dissecting the concept of freedom,
poking holes in relativism, or examining what "engineering" really means in software.

If you're interested in thoughtful critique of everyday assumptions—whether about life goals, medicine, work culture,
or societal norms—and aren't afraid of the occasional blunt opinion,
you'll likely find something here worth reading (or arguing with).

Above all, I believe it's worth striving for a life examined, not merely lived.
