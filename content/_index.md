# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, and welcome!
This portfolio is a curated collection of my personal side projects-things I've built out of curiosity, passion,
and a drive to explore new ideas.
Unlike the work I've done for past employers (which remains closed-source), everything here is open for you to explore.

These projects reflect my practical understanding of software engineering principles-from designing scalable systems
and writing clean, maintainable code, to choosing the right tools for the job.
You'll see a mix of technologies and programming languages as I enjoy working across the stack
and diving into new domains when a project calls for it.

Whether you're here to evaluate my technical skills or just to explore what I've been building,
I hope you find something interesting. Feel free to reach out-I'm always open to feedback and collaboration!

# [My Knowledge Repository]({{< relref "knowledge-repo.md" >}})

I'm a lifelong learner. Learning is my commitment-it gives my life meaning and purpose.
Everything else is a means to that end, tools that support and enable my learning.

I've been maintaining this [personal knowledge repository](https://github.com/hungcq/knowledge-repo) since 2021.
It's where I distill and document what I've learned, primarily from books, but also from other types of material.
The topics are broad, spanning philosophy, science, software engineering, and business.

## [Knowledge Repo - RAG Chatbot](https://github.com/hungcq/knowledge-repo-rag)
I wanted to understand how a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application works,
so I built this chatbot from scratch to answer questions using resources from my knowledge repo.

This is a **Python** project with two versions:
- Local version: uses **Qdrant** as the vector database, **Nomic** for text embeddings (via vLLM),
and a **LLaMA**-based model running locally with **GPT4All**.
- API-based version: uses **OpenAI embeddings** and queries **GPT via OpenAI API**.

Things I'd like to improve (when time permits):
- Add a GitHub pipeline to automatically update the vector store whenever I update the knowledge repo.
- Deploy the local version to the cloud (though that might cost me a bit ðŸ˜‚).
